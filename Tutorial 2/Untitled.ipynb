    "\n",
    "Uninformed search (also called blind search) is a category of search algorithms used in Artificial Intelligence that explore a search space without any domain-specific knowledge — that is, they have no information about the goal’s location beyond the problem definition itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "They simply use the structure of the problem (like possible states and transitions) to search for a goal, without any heuristic guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uninformed search algorithms explore nodes systematically — they don’t know which paths are more promising. They just follow a predefined strategy (e.g., breadth-first, depth-first, etc.) until they find a goal."

    "What are differences between informed search and uninformed search?\n",
    "\n",
    "Informed search — also known as heuristic search — is a type of search strategy in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses extra knowledge or heuristics about the problem domain to guide the search more efficiently toward the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike uninformed search, which explores blindly, informed search uses estimates of how close a given state is to the goal to make smarter decisions about which path to explore next."
